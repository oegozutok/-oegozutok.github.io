# Data Analytics & Science Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of my data science projects. Each project is briefly described below along with a link to its detailed documentation or code.

## Projects

### Stock Market Noise Analysis and Simulation [View Project](stockproj.ipynb)
- Description: Utilized Python in conjunction with NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to conduct comprehensive financial analysis. Tasks included correlation studies, noise ratio calculations, and Monte Carlo simulations. Implemented Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) for stock price simulations, reflecting best practices in high-performance computing. Demonstrated proficiency in Linux OS for system management and data analysis tasks. Explored and assessed various approaches including denoising, wavelet transform, and machine learning techniques to analyze and understand the underlying nature of stock market behavior.
- Duration: Oct 2023 – Dec 2023
- Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn

### Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing [View Project](twitternlp.ipynb)
- Description: Developed a Twitter sentiment analysis model leveraging BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) with TensorFlow and Keras. Preprocessed Twitter data using BERT tokenizer for tokenization and contextual word embeddings. Trained and fine-tuned the BERT model on a large Twitter dataset to accurately classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
- Duration: Mar 2023 – Apr 2023
- Technologies: Python, nltk, Tensorflow, Keras, Bert
